  Change Log
  
V3.0.11.4 - July 2017
---------------------
* Including examples in version 2 cfdg files includes the version 2 variant
  of the example.
* The missing shape rule error message now says where the problem is.

  Bug fixes:

* Fix handling of Mac OS9 line endings.
* Mac: Gallery upload sheet fails to display if the user has no stored 
  credentials.
* Mac: Tiled designs save/upload at the wrong resolution on systems with
  retina displays.

V3.0.11.3 - June 2017
---------------------
* Makefile updated to match Debian conventions.

  Bug fixes:

* Mac: Crash on rendering files with errors.
* Mac: Render sub-window collapsed or set to a random size.
* CF::AllowOverlap was not being processed at the right time to suppress 
  overlap warnings.
* Makefile failing to work in many situations.

V3.0.11 - June 2017
-------------------
* Animation has changed from an output save option to a first-class operation. 
  You do not need to render first to generate a movie. Instead, select the 
  Animate command from the Render menu. You will be shown a preview of the 
  movie.
* Individual movie frames can also be rendered, for testing. Select Animate 
  Frame command from the Render menu, or use the --frame option on the command 
  line.
* Windows, command-line: Movie output now uses the H.264 or the ProRes format. 
  Support for Apple Animation codec is removed.
* Windows: User interface has been updated to a more modern look.
* Mac: Some open-source code with an insufficiently free license has been 
  replaced with completely free code. This should satisfy a Debian bug filed on 
  Context Free.
* A variable named Ï€ (pi) has been defined with the expected value. An entry 
  in the Insert Character submenu has been added.
* It is now possible to multiply or divide a vector by scalar value and each 
  element will be multiplied or divided by that value. Vectors can also be 
  multiplied by divided by vectors of the same size; element by element 
  multiplication or division will result.
* command line: The example cfdg files have been embedded in the command-line 
  version, just as they are in the GUI versions. They can be imported into 
  other designs in any version.

  Bug fixes:
  
* Improperly terminated comments could cause Context Free/cfdg to hang.
* A spurious error, "Invalid UTF-8 encoding: ASCII null character", can be 
  reported for valid cfdg input if a shape name is the very last token in a 
  cfdg file.
* Cfdg files that only have FILL shapes in them and no SQUAREs, CIRCLEs, 
  TRIANGLEs, or paths will fail to draw anything.
* A dependency on Bison 3.03 was accidentally introduced. Context Free/cfdg is 
  supposed to depend on Bison 2.5.

V3.0.10 - January 2017
----------------------

* Uploading from Context Free now uses HTTPS instead of HTTP, which 
  www.contextfreeart.org now requires. Context Free also stores your password 
  encrypted.

  Bug fixes:
  
* Shape adjustments of the form x expr1 y expr2 are not evaluated correctly if 
  expr2 is random or depends on a shape parameter and expr1 does not.
* The case values in switch statements are supposed allow for arbitrary 
  constant expressions, but anything except an integer constant produces an 
  error.
* fixed (command-line): Sometimes crashes while generating animation output.

v3.0.9 - May 2015
-----------------

* New random distribution functions added.

  Bug fixes:
  
* Crashes when there is a typo in a function name
* Crashes when shapes or paths take rules as parameters under certain esoteric 
  conditions
* Perfectly symmetric self-intersecting paths will get silently dropped.
* Symmetry groups pm, pg, pmg, and cm are broken.

v3.0.8 - June 2014
------------------

* Errors that occur during SVG file output are reported to the user. Previously 
  they were silent.

  Bug Fixes:
  
* OS X: Some automatic text substitutions are occurring in the cfdg edit box. 
  The proper subtraction operator is being converted to an m-dash.
* Windows: SVG files cannot be saved.

v3.0.7 - May 2014
-----------------

  Bug Fixes:
  
* OS X: Random crash while rendering tiled cfdg files
* Parser error confuses the colon in switch statement case and else bodies with 
  the colons used for namespaces.

v3.0.6 - February 2014
----------------------

* The maximum length for vectors is increased from 9 to 99.

  Bug Fixes:
  
* A memory leak can fill memory with parameter blocks, causing Context Free to 
  crash.
* Modification terms of the form x 1 1 n get silently converted to z n. The 
  x 1 1 gets dropped.
* Transform and clone statements with non-constant symmetry arguments cause 
  Context Free to crash
* Configuration variables that depend on global variables fail if the global 
  variable is not constant
* Windows: Color calculator generates incorrect CFDG code in locales where the 
  decimal mark is a comma.
* Windows: Incorrect text (or no text) in some dialog fields can trigger an 
  uncaught exception.

v3.0.5 - January 2013
---------------------

* Variable name shadowing rules have been relaxed. A variable can have the same 
  name as a variable in an outer level of scope.
* Windows: Performance improved for designs with many shapes.
* Windows: Context Free properly registers for handling cfdg files.
* Two-value color targets and stateful color targets can be used together in 
  the same version 2 cfdg file.

  Bug fixes:
  
* Crash when parsing version 2 paths.
* User interface hangs for designs with many, many shapes.
* User interface hangs for designs with very long running rules.
* Negative brightness, saturation, and alpha adjustments work correctly in 
  adjustment variables and parameters.
* Crash when closing a window that had temporary files associated with it on 
  OS X.
* FILL primitive shape is no longer duplicated by CF::Symmetry operations.
* Makefile references libm.
* Crash when multiplying output vertically (Posix and Windows CLI).

v3.0.4 - December 2012
----------------------

* User interface hangs have been fixed for designs with many, many shapes
* User interface hangs have been fixed for designs with very long running rules
* Variable name shadowing rules have been relaxed. A variable can have the same 
  name as a variable in an outer level of scope.
* W: Performance improved for designs with many shapes

* Windows command-line version reports the wrong version number
* Memory corruption occurs if the background is not opaque, results in random 
  errors
* Visible seams on tiled images that have very small shapes at the tile edge

  ?: operator, but over multiple values
* Conditional code: switch statements and if statements
* Included files can be placed in their own namespace to prevent name collisions
* Numeric parameters are restricted to prevent creation of context-sensitive 
  grammars
* The color target feature has been replaced with something that provides the 
  same benefit but is less confusing.
* Shape time, allows you to specify which frames a shape is visible in during 
  movie generation
* New FILL primitive shape, fills the canvas with the specified color at the 
  specified Z. Similar to the background, but you can interleaves shapes and 
  FILLs in Z.
* 16-bit color depth

v2.2 - January 2009
-------------------

* Optional size directive lets you crop your design
* Paths for user-defined primitive shapes
* Expressions
* Extensions to Loops
* Mac and Windows clients support 6-letter variation codes
* New client for the Windows command line
* Windows client ported from MFC framework to .NET 2.0 framework, should 
  compile with (free) Visual Studio Express 2005
* Ability to set a Creative Commons license for use when uploading designs
* Stronger random number generator used for picking random variations
* Quiet mode for Posix and Windows command line clients suppress non-error 
  output
* Option to insert variation code in output file names and also to change how 
  animation frame numbers are inserted
* Included file names can be in double quotes, which allows for spaces in file 
  names and file names that do not end in .cfdg
* SVG file shapes are flattened so that they can be edited in Inkscape

  Disappearing Features:

* Rule names cannot contain '-' or '.'
* Rule names cannot begin with a digit
* The following rules names are no longer allowed: path, MOVETO, LINETO, ARCTO, 
  CURVETO, MOVEREL, LINEREL, ARCREL, CURVEREL, and CLOSEPOLY, x1, x2, y1, y2, 
  rx, ry, p, param, width
* Included file names must end with a .cfdg extension, be in the same directory 
  as the original cfdg file, and contain no spaces, unless the file name is in 
  double quotes

  Bug Fixes:

* variation code spinner control wraps properly between variation A and 
  variation ZZZZZZ
* i_curves.cfdg rule names are now legal
* very large shapes were not tiling properly
* variations work the same on big-endian (PowerPC) and little-endian (x86) 
  systems. Big-endian variations are still available.
* Proper GPLv2 copyright notices are present in all files
* QuickTime movies with transparent backgrounds work
* Propagated alpha computation fix from 32-bit pixel formats to 24 and 8-bit 
  pixel formats
* Some warnings generated by GCC 4.3 have been fixed
* Very large bezier curves do not blow up the memory requirements
* W: tiled animations were not working
* P: crash case on malformed cfdg files from standard input fixed

  Known Issues:

* If you have a typo in a path operation or path command (e.g., moveto instead 
  of MOVETO) then it will be treated as a FILL path command. The proper 
  treatment should be to list it as an unrecognized path operation/command.
* W: When uploading to the gallery, if you change the cfdg text in the edit 
  window after rendering then the changed text will not be uploaded to the 
  gallery. Context Free under Windows takes a snap-shot of the cfdg text each 
  time it is rendered and this snap-shot is what is uploaded. The work-around 
  is to re-render before uploading to the gallery.
* W: Crashes during upload to gallery under Windows 7 RC1. This will probably 
  force a minor release.
* P: Images with transparent backgrounds are stored in the PNG file with 
  pre-multiplied alpha, but the PNG specification says to use non-premultiplied 
  alpha.

v2.1 - April 2007
-----------------

* Tiled rendering for cfdg mosaics
* W,M Tiled cfdgs will display as tiled
* W,M If the tile transform is skewed then Context Free can save a superset of

  code is less hideous now)
* W Instead of installing a local copy of the runtime DLLs (always a bad idea), 
  the Windows runtime installer is executed from the Context Free installer
* Only generates 32-bit PNG files if the background is non-opaque, otherwise 
  generates 8- or 24-bit PNG files

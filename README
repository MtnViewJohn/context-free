MACINTOSH BUILD NOTES

Requires Xcode 6 & Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion).
Developed with XCode 8.3.2 and Mac OS X 10.12 (Sierra), has not been tested
with older versions of XCode or Mac OS X.

The Xcode project file is in the top directory:
    ./Context Free.xcodeproj

WINDOWS GUI BUILD NOTES

Requires Visual Studio 2015 or later.

The VS2015 solution file is at ./src-net/ContextFreeNetVS11.sln

If you modify cfdg.l or cfdg.ypp then you must rebuild the parser files 
in src-win/derived. If you have Cygwin or a similar Posix environment 
installed or have access to a Unix/Linux or Mac system then cd to 
src-win/derived and type 'make' (you will need bison and flex too).

WINDOWS CLI (command line) BUILD NOTES

Requires Visual Studio 2015 or later.

The VS2015 CLI solution file is at ./ContextFreeCLIVS11.sln

If you modify cfdg.l or cfdg.ypp then you must rebuild the parser files 
in src-win/derived. If you have Cygwin or a similar Posix environment 
installed or have access to a Unix/Linux or Mac system then cd to 
src-win/derived and type 'make' (you will need bison and flex too).

BSD/LINUX/UNIX/POSIX BUILD NOTES

You'll need a c++ compiler, flex (not lex), bison 2.5 and the libpng Library. 
Most of this should be installed or easily available on any modern operating
system distribution.  If you need it, libpng can be found here:
    http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html    
    
The Makefile assumes that libpng is installed at /usr/local/lib. If libpng is
installed in a different location then you must update the LIB_DIRS variable
in the Makefile with this location.

From the top level, you should just run:
    $ make

You'll see a warning about "mktemp" and "mkstemp" during the link step.
This can be ignored.

To run the program, try something like:
    $ ./cfdg -s 500 input/mtree.cfdg mtree.png

Run it with -? to get a usage summary:
    $ ./cfdg -?

'make check' will test your compiled cfdg executable. 'sudo make install'
will install cfdg and the cfdg.1 man page in /usr/local.

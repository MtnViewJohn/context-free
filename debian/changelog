contextfree (3.0.11.4+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release and new maintainer. (Closes: #770324)
  * Remove src-ffmpeg, src-osx, src-net, src-win, src-net from
    upstream source tarball. (Closes: #823144)
  * Remove patches 01_disable_ffmpeg_support.patch,
    02_do_not_link_against_libz.patch, 04-gcc-4.8-atomic.patch.
    All have been fixed in upstream.
  * Context Free depends on the latest version of libagg, which
    has been added to package libagg-dev at version 1:2.4. Added
    patch 02_use_external_libagg.patch to use libagg-dev. src-agg
    has been removed from the upstream tarball.
  * Added libagg-dev to Build-Depends (because of the above patch).
  * Updated Standards-Version to 4.0.1. Priority changed from
    extra to optional. copyright-format URL uses https.
  * Remove debian/repack.sh. Use a Files-Exluded line in
    debian/copyright instead.
  * Add explicit dependence on package libfl-dev as it is a
    recommended dependence of flex but contextfree requires it.

contextfree (2.2+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added patch 03_link_against_libm to fix FTBFS with --no-add-needed, which
    is the default when building using binutils-gold.  Thanks to Ilya Barygin
    <barygin@gmail.com>, who fixed this in Ubuntu (closes: #554116).
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to the depends of the contextfree binary package.

    which are undistributable according to the DFSG.
  * Updated debian/README.source to note this fact.

contextfree (2.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added patch 02_do_not_link_against_libz, to not uselessly link agains libz
    (thanks to dpkg-shlibdeps for the warning).

contextfree (2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (thanks to Paul van Tilburg and Joachim Breitner for
    motivating me to actually package this!).
  * Dropped patch 01_add_headers; fixed upstream.
  * Updated manpage for cfdg 2.2.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.0.  This requires contextfree to be built
    against an external version of libagg instead of the included sources, so
    added patch 01_use_external_libagg to do that.  Note that we are still
    using the included libagg header files instead of the external ones, as the
    included copy has modifications that are needed for building contextfree.
    This has also been noted in debian/README.source.
  * Added libagg-dev to Build-Depends (because of the above patch).
  * Updated copyright years in debian/copyright.
  * Initial upload to Debian (closes: #461751).
